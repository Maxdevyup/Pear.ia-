# Pear.ia-
Bittorent of AI 🍐
What is Peer.AI ?
Peer.AI is an open-source distributed AI platform. The idea is simple : instead of relying on expensive centralized servers, every user contributes a small part of their PC's idle computing power to the network and earns credits in return. Use those credits to run AI queries. Think uTorrent, but for artificial intelligence.
No crypto. No blockchain.  Just people helping people run AI.
Get Paid for that!

Why ?
Running AI today means depending on OpenAI, Google, or paying for cloud GPUs. Peer.AI wants to change that — making AI accessible to everyone by using the power that already exists in millions of personal computers sitting idle around the world. ( no more gpu shortage Nvidia)

Status 🚧
